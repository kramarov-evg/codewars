Nothing truly interesting here. If you're unsure, wheteher you want to see what's in here, you highly likely don't.

# What's that?
I'll store my codewars solutions here. Only those, that I find unevident or worth keeping. Separate directory for each kata in case I get an idea how to update/improve my solutions (that doesn't happen often). Kata's instructions can be seen in README for that kata alongside with some other info I decide to store about that kata. If you've already reached here, you must be really bored. Good luck, outlander!
